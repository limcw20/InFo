# InFo
## Project Description
#### A change of approach in internet forum where users matchmake into discussion rooms to actively discuss their interests.

## Feature Goals
#### - A host user can create a post to start a discussion. This discussion will randomly appear on other users' discovery page.
#### - Users are able to choose to participate or pass on the discussion. If they pass, another discussion created from other host users will show up, and the cycle repeats.
#### - If the user participates, they will be brought into a chatroom to proceed discussion with the host user, along with other participating users.
#### - The host user also has authority to kick other users, set post visibility to public or just within participants, and lock/unlock posts.
